## Introduction to Machine Learning: Regression Models

This workshop focuses on regression models to provide participants with a foundational understanding of machine learning concepts, techniques, and tools used for linear and nonlinear regression. Through a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises, participants will gain practical experience with regression algorithms, one of the most popular machine-learning techniques. The workshop begins with an overview of regression, exploring its various types and applications and continues with training regression models, interpreting the results, and making predictions using real-world datasets. Additionally, participants will gain insights into advanced topics such as regularization and feature selection. By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of regression models and be familiar with popular Python libraries and tools to implement them.

In this workshop, we will use cloud-based platforms, so you donâ€™t need to have Python installed. Please make sure that you have a Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/) account. This workshop will involve hands-on exercises that require the use of programming tools and libraries commonly used in machine learning, such as Python and Scikit-learn. As such, prior familiarity with Python programming is recommended for participants to fully benefit from the practical component of the workshop.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Understand regression models and their applications in machine learning.
2. Learn to load and preprocess data effectively and train regression models for real-world datasets.
3. Interpret and analyze regression model results, including performance metrics and coefficients.
